  <h2>Meet Our Staff</h2>

  <!-- Persona 1 -->
  <div class="staff-card left">
    <img src="../images/Marisol-Calderon-Picture.png" alt="Dr. Marisol “Sol” Calderón">
    <div>
      <h3>Dr. Marisol “Sol” Calderón</h3>
      <h4>Coastal Archaeologist</h4>
      <p><strong>Expertise:</strong> Specialist in late Holocene maritime archaeology, with emphasis on coastal shell-middens, seafaring materials, and ceramic trade networks of the northeastern Pacific Rim.</p>
      <p>Dr. Calderón holds a PhD in Maritime Archaeology from the University of Washington and completed a postdoctoral fellowship in zooarchaeology under Prof. H. Nakamura. Her training blends classical field excavation with wet-site conservation techniques and ceramic petrography. She’s expert at stratigraphic excavation, faunal identification, AMS radiocarbon sampling, and residue analysis. In the field she uses drones for shoreline mapping, portable XRF for quick geochemical screening, flotation tanks, and meticulous paper + digital field notebooks. Sol’s approach is methodical and meticulous — she treats fragile contexts like clockwork and keeps exceptionally detailed provenience records. Outside the trench she’s an enthusiastic public communicator who runs community dig days and teaches kids how to sieve finds without breaking them.</p>
      <p><strong>Museum Role:</strong> Lead Researcher for the Coastal Collections: cataloging incoming maritime collections, designing the upcoming “Tides & Trade” exhibit, and supervising conservation treatment of waterlogged artifacts.</p>
      <p><strong>Special Considerations:</strong> Recipient of the Pacific Fieldwork Fellowship and a National Endowment for the Humanities grant for community archaeology outreach. Bilingual (Spanish/English) with deep partnerships among local fishing communities. Known for developing low-vision-friendly tactile labels for exhibit objects and insisting on community-led interpretation panels.</p>

  <!-- Persona 2 -->
  <div class="staff-card right">
    <img src="../images/Avery-Mensah-Picture.png" alt="Avery K. Mensah">
    <div>
      <h3>Avery K. Mensah</h3>
      <h4>Urban Anthropologist</h4>
      <p><strong>Expertise:</strong> Urban anthropologist specializing in digital material culture, informal economies, and vernacular architecture in rapidly changing port cities of West Africa and the Pacific Northwest.</p>
      <p>Avery earned an MA in Cultural Anthropology from UCLA and completed doctoral coursework in ethnography and digital methods under Prof. L. E. Okoye. Their skills include participant observation, oral history collection, audio/video ethnography, transcription and translation (Twi/English), and rapid participatory mapping. Technically fluent with handheld LIDAR scanners, NVivo for qualitative coding, and open-source GIS for mapping social infrastructures. Avery’s personal style is curious, empathetic, and quietly irreverent — they combine rigorous analysis with playful field experiments such as pop-up market installations and collaborative zines. They prize co-created metadata and community archiving, often training local youth to run oral history stations.</p>
      <p><strong>Museum Role:</strong> Curator of Social Worlds: designing immersive, community-sourced displays about urban life and informal economies; leading an oral history project for a permanent “City Things” installation and advising on ethical display of living cultural practices.</p>
      <p><strong>Special Considerations:</strong> Recipient of a community-partnership grant and a digital preservation fellowship. Avery is neurodivergent (ADHD) and views it as an asset for spotting everyday improvisations others miss. They prioritize co-curation, informed consent, and open access — offering free weekend transcription workshops that make archives more inclusive.</p>

  <!-- Persona 3 -->
  <div class="staff-card left">
    <img src="../images/Lyra-Voss-Picture.png" alt="Dr. Lyra N. Voss">
    <div>
      <h3>Lyra N. Voss</h3>
      <h4>Mythographer & Cultural Semiotician</h4>
      <p><strong>Expertise:</strong> Interprets symbolic language, mythic narratives, and recurring cultural symbols that bridge folklore, philosophy, and semiotics across time and media.</p>
      <p>Lyra Voss earned her PhD in Comparative Mythology and Semiotics from the University of Chicago, studying under Dr. Ananya Rao. Her work decodes recurring symbols that migrate across eras—from cave markings to modern logos—and she’s collaborated with museums in London, Seattle, and Oaxaca to reframe mythic narratives as living traditions. Her interpretive lens draws from feminist semiotics and indigenous epistemologies of storykeeping. Lyra is both a skeptic and a dreamer—she believes in rigorous structural analysis, but also in story as cultural medicine. She’s passionate about myth fragments, oral tales, and ritualized gestures that survive in everyday life unnoticed.</p>
      <p><strong>Interpretive Method:</strong> Lyra constructs meaning through layered comparison—cross-referencing oral traditions, interviewing storytellers, and mapping metaphor families using AI-assisted linguistic tools. She collaborates with multimedia artists to build immersive installations that let visitors “walk inside” a myth. Her exhibits blend scholarship with imagination, inviting co-interpretation rather than passive viewing.</p>
      <p><strong>Special Considerations:</strong> A queer scholar of mixed Nordic and Caribbean heritage, Lyra challenges colonial curatorial traditions. She advocates for counter-narrative storytelling and recently launched the “Echoing Myths” project, repatriating oral stories to local archives with new translations by community poets.</p>
