      <h2>Echoes of the Human Story</h2>
      <p>Step inside a place where memory refuses to fade. Our museum isn’t just about artifacts — 
        it’s about the people, the myths, and the voices that still hum beneath the dust. 
        We seek what time tried to silence and invite you to listen closer.</p>
      <p>Join us in the search — to uncover what was buried, to protect what was whispered, 
        and to give forgotten worlds a place to speak again. Volunteers welcome. Curiosity required.</p>
